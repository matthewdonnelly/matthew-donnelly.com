                                <h3>Rising Tide Virtual Reality Solutions LLC, Founder</h3>
                                <p>Founded and led a company specializing in the development of VR experiences to enhance interdisciplinary research. Spearheaded the creation of a Digital Twin for Colby College, translating LiDAR data into a vivid 3D landscape that replicates the topography of Allen Island. Crafted interactive environments for Bowdoin College, transforming static data into dynamic VR experiences that engage and educate.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Emerging Technologies Lab, Director</h3>
                                <p>Directed the VR research lab at Bowdoin College, fostering interdisciplinary projects to empower faculty research. Developed an interactive VR model that simulates the geoscience field lab experience, incorporating educational goals and interactive learning. This model was central to a human subject research study assessing the system's efficacy.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Neuroscience Department, Bowdoin College</h3>
                                <p>As a Teaching Assistant, I guided undergraduates through complex molecular pathways of the central and peripheral nervous systems, enhancing their grasp of key concepts and applications. I facilitated the critical analysis of research articles, mentoring students in synthesizing and authoring scientific reviews.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Computer Science Department, Bowdoin College</h3>
                                <p>During my tenure as a Freedman Summer Research Fellow, I implemented a VR research framework leveraging Unity Engine. This system connected to an online database to capture and analyze participant data, streamlining the collection and study of performance metrics in VR research settings.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Celularity Inc., Medical Affairs Intern</h3>
                                <p>My role involved conducting a thorough literature review on the pioneering use of stem cell therapy in treating Parkinsonâ€™s Disease. I developed a protocol for the production of stem cell-derived neurons, presenting a viable treatment protocol to the executive team that has the potential to propel the project into a significant phase of development.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Bowdoin College & University of Maine VEMI Lab</h3>
                                <p>As a Gibbons Summer Research Fellow, I established Bowdoin College's inaugural VR research lab, aimed at bolstering faculty research through virtual reality technologies. Collaborating with the VEMI Lab at the University of Maine, we worked to create immersive VR environments for educational and research purposes.</p>
